                            Abstract: A major challenge facing healthcare organizations (hospitals, medical centers) is the provision of quality services at affordable costs. Quality service implies diagnosing patients correctly and administering treatments that are effective. Poor clinical decisions can lead to disastrous consequences which are therefore unacceptable. Hospitals must also minimize the cost of clinical tests. They can achieve these results by employing appropriate computer-based information and/or decision support systems.<br>

                            Most hospitals today employ some sort of hospital information systems to manage their healthcare or patient data. These systems are designed to support patient billing, inventory management and generation of simple statistics. Some hospitals use decision support systems, but they<br>
                            
                            are largely limited.<br>
                            
                            Clinical decisions are often made based on doctorsâ€™ intuition and experience rather than on the knowledge rich data hidden in the database. This practice leads to unwanted biases, errors and excessive medical costs which affects the quality of service provided to patients.<br>
                            
                            The main objective of this project is to develop an Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System using the data mining modeling technique, namely, NaÃ¯ve<br>
                            
                            Bayes. It is implemented as web based questionnaire application .Based on the user answers, it can discover and extract hidden knowledge (patterns and relationships) associated with heart disease from a historical heart disease database. It can answer complex queries for diagnosing heart disease<br>
                            
                            and thus assist healthcare practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems cannot. By providing effective treatments, it also helps to services at affordable costs. Quality service implies diagnosing patients correctly and administering reduce treatment costs.<br>
